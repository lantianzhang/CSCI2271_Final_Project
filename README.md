## Acknowledgements   
We express our thanks to the maintainers and providers of segmentation-models-pytorch for the implementation of UNet++ and Deeplabv3+ https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch?tab=readme-ov-file and JDTLoss function https://github.com/zifuwanggg/JDTLosses https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05666  

We would also like to thank Professor Fergus for introducing us to the world of computer vision in this course. 
We couldn't imagine that we could go from having little to no prior experience in computer vision to researching, developing, and testing out a custom unet implementation in the course of a single semester.
